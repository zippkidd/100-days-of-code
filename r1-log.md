### R1D17
started the Wikipedia viewer for FCC and struggled the virtual host configs in apache. [CodePen Link](https://codepen.io/zippkidd)

### R1D18
Back to logging my work. Over the past two weeks I went through most of Wes Bos's JS30 video lectures and made a Simon game with vanilla JS. I had also managed to finally figure out how to structure a proper query to the Wikipedia API for the wiki viewer project. [CodePen Link](https://codepen.io/zippkidd)

### R1D19
Working on my digital portfolio. Using the Bootstrap grid to create a showcase section. Figured out how to layer the rows on top of each other so that I can remove the opacity with :hover of the top screenshot layer to show a description of the project.

### R1D20
Worked on a mobile friendly alternative to the layered grid rows using bootstrap media breakpoints. Went through the great interactive tutorials cssgridgarden and flexboxfroggy to get a feel of how to structure my grid without bootstrap

### R1D21
My portfolio's showcase section grid is functioning the way I want it to! Such a great feeling. Next up is populating it with my projects.

### R1D22
Added content and some styling to the grid. Made a simple footer with fontawesome icons and styled them.

### R1D23
Worked on the header/intro of my portfolio. After some frustration, realized my background-clip property was returning to it's  default setting because of my shorthand background declaration further  down in the rule.

### R1D24
Finished header. Working nicely and it's responsive!

### R1D25
Reviewed jQuery to help a friend with smooth scrolling on his site. Set up PyCharm to start my Python journey!

### R1D26
Added some smooth scrolling effects to my portfolio. Next I'm going to add a background image to the site with a parallax effect.

### R1D27
Added the parallax effect! Also made some minor tweaks to the style, chose and implemented a Google font family, and learned about image compression to minimize the loading time of my site.

### R1D28
Added finishing touches to my portfolio like replacing the dead links with actual live ones. Worked through another JS30 lecture, always great stuff there.

### R1D29
Converted images in my portfolio to JPEG and compressed their size to increase load time. Added some meta tags with descriptions and key words. Indexed my site with Google and verified it with Google Web Master's with another meta tag. The [website](https://thomastylek.github.io/) is now live and hosted on GitHub!

### R1D30
Learned about event delegation and local storage through JS30. Starting to read through You Don't Know JavaScript for extra review.

### R1D31
Added some extra functionality to Wes Bos's app to complete his challenge at the end of the video lecture. Read through another chapter of YDKJS.

### R1D32
Read more YDKJS. Worked through another JS30 video lecture.

### R1D33
Reading more YDKJS. Started working on the FCC Twitch TV app challenge.

### R1D34
Worked on the Twitch TV app. Successfully receiving JSON responses from Twitch, experimented with accessing the different types of data in the JSON that I can put in the web app.

### R1D35
Switched from jQuery's $.ajax()/$.getJSON to the new fetch API for the TwitchTV app. Found out I was accidentally requesting JSONP which fetch can't process with the help from FCC's JS gitter.

### R1D36
Successfully using a for loop to create separate fetch requests and populating the results as list items in the HTML. Now to work on the CSS to pretty it up a little.

### R1D37
Didn't get to the CSS styling. Ended up polishing up the HTML populated from my results to show more of the response's info, organized it more, and set a couple minutes long interval to retrieving the data through the API to make sure the user sees current data.

### R1D38
Worked with CSS on the stylesheet. Using flex to keep the resulting data centered on the page. Removed <li> standard styles and plan on customizing with background color radius and box-shadow.

### R1D39
Gave the <li> elements the custom styling mentioned yesterday. Will add the finishing touches of some gradient background colors to the project tomorrow.

### R1D40
Took a break from my previous project. Riding the wave of inspiration from a squiggly line animation on a blog I saw and spent this morning trying to recreate it. Got the squiggly line now just for some CSS3 animations.
